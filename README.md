## **Eye Blink & Sleep Detection System**

This project focuses on enhancing road safety by reducing accidents caused by driver drowsiness. The system uses advanced computer vision techniques to monitor the driverâ€™s eye blinks and detect signs of drowsiness in real time.

## **ðŸ”‘ Key Features:**

-**Eye Blink Detection:** Tracks the frequency and duration of eye blinks to assess the driverâ€™s alertness level.
-**Sleep Detection:** Identifies prolonged eye closure or reduced blink activity as indicators of drowsiness.
-**Sound Alert System:** Emits a loud alarm to immediately alert the driver when drowsiness is detected.
## **ðŸ“š Technologies Used:**

-**Python:** For scripting and integrating functionalities.
-**OpenCV:** For real-time eye detection and blink tracking.
-**winsound:** To generate customizable sound alerts directly through the operating system.
-**Mediapipe:** For facial landmark detection.
## **ðŸš€ Impact:**
This project addresses a critical real-world problem by offering a proactive solution to prevent drowsiness-related accidents. It can be further extended for use in industries requiring high attention levels, such as aviation, long-haul trucking, and heavy machinery operation.
